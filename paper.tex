\section{Introduction}
% Explanation of pursuit-evasion problem in general.
% The two various methods for analyzing the problem
% a solution for blending the two solutions together

\section{Paradigm 1 - Discrete Formulation}
% explanation of the paradigm
% mathematical definitions and/or data structures
% general rules of "play"
% planar graphs need max three pursuers

\section{Paradigm 2 - Formulation on the Continuous Plane}
% explanation of the paradigm
% mathematical definitions and/or data structures
% general setup and rules of "play"
% visibility polygons and gap management
% area contamination and management
% NP-hardness

\section{Blended Paradigm Concept}
